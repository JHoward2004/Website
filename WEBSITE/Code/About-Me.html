I'm Jack, a computer science major, media fan, and self described "nerd". I'm always been fascinated by computers, 
both in regards to how they work and how we integrate them into our life. This unsuprisingly developed into a love
for computer science but also for arts of all kinds, especially digital. I have hobbies in music composition, photograpghy, creative writing, and 
have been learning 3D design! There is so much in the natural world and the artificial world to explore and I always find mor-e to learn.
