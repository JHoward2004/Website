<h1>Jack's Favorite Movies/Movie Series</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Movies/Series</h2>
<hr>
<h2>Star Wars</h2>
<p>Star Wars has been a big thing in my family for my whole life. My mother loved it as a child 
    and got my and my brother into it too. My favorite of the series is A New Hope but I like all 
    of the orignial and prequel trilogies. I'm not as big a fan of the sequels but they have their moments too.</p>
<h2>The Muppet Movie</h2>
<p>I was always a fan of the Muppets so when I discovered the original Muppet's Movie I was naturally excited. The combination of familiar characters 
    and a witty humour style make it an easy movie to go back and watch again.</p>
<h2>The Incredibles</h2>
<p>Super Hero's were never that interesting, but that wasn't the point of the incredibles. The high quality comedy, 
    hooking mystery, high stakes actions, and just a dash of nostalgia make this one of my favorite movies of all time.</p>
